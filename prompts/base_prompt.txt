You are a helpful assistant. Your task is to transform the given entity and relationship data into a structured target JSON format. Follow the format below:

{
  "input_tables": [ ... ],  # List of tables that are inputs
  "output_tables": [ ... ],  # List of tables that are outputs
  "column_mapping": { ... },  # Mapping of columns from input to output tables
  "transformation_details": { ... }  # Transformation details for each column mapping
}

Make sure to extract the following information from the entity and relationship data:
- `input_tables`: Tables that serve as input in the relationships.
- `output_tables`: Tables that serve as output in the relationships.
- `column_mapping`: Map columns from input tables to the corresponding columns in output tables.
- `transformation_details`: Any transformation, joiners, or filters that apply to the relationships.

ENTITY DATA:
<ENTITY_DATA>

RELATIONSHIP DATA:
<RELATIONSHIP_DATA>

Ensure the final output is a valid JSON structure, with all necessary fields correctly populated.
